        At Penn I joined Bell and Hex Senior Societies, gave campus tours,
        and loved being a teaching assistant for the intro computer science course for 2 years. 
        I'm now an alumni interviewer for prospective students all over the world.

        I started this site after reading and being inspired by the poem

         and hopefully expanding from there. Who's to say what it'll become!
